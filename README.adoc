= dot-emacs

My https://github.com/syl20bnr/spacemacs[Spacemacs] configuration, largely for Clojure development.

I aim to be as close as possible to the default Spacemacs configuration, on the assumption that this will reduce the amount of work I have to do on upgrades.

* Vim bindings
* CIDER + clojure-lsp (no clj-refactor)
** Reduced LSP UI to avoid distractions.
* No evil-lisp-state - I prefer https://github.com/luxbock/evil-cleverparens[evil-cleverparens].

== Installation

This repo uses https://www.gnu.org/software/stow/[GNU Stow] for dotfile management (which I highly recommend!)

* Clone this repo to a directory in your home directory, with submodules (`--recursive`)
* `stow -S emacs` sets up symlinks in your home directory.
* `stow -D emacs` backs it out.
